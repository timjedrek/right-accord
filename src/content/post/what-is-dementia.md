Just because you or a loved one is becoming forgetful, don’t immediately assume dementia is the cause. Forgetfulness can result from many things, including fatigue, medications, poor nutrition, excessive alcohol use, and more.

“Dementia” is a general term used to describe a decline in mental ability that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. The most well-known and most common type of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease. While receiving a dementia diagnosis may seem daunting, many live active, happy lives for years after receiving their diagnosis.

Early Signs of Dementia
-----------------------

Although memory loss is one symptom of dementia, memory loss alone is not enough for a diagnosis of dementia. Memory loss would need to be combined with one or more of the following:

**Language issues:** Difficulty expressing one’s thoughts; struggling to find the right words to express oneself, or forgetting the meaning of specific words

**Personality changes:** Mood changes are common, including depression and a lack of interest in hobbies and other activities; shy people may suddenly become more outgoing.

**Difficulty completing tasks:** Complex, multi-step tasks may slowly become more challenging, things like balancing a check book, following a simple recipe, or playing games with lots of rules.

**Failing Sense of direction:** Getting lost returning from familiar locations and not recognizing once-familiar landmarks is a another common sign of dementia.

**Difficulty following storylines:** Failure to understand the storyline of familiar TV programs or difficulty following conversations is a classic symptom of dementia.

**Struggling to adapt to change:** People in the early stages of dementia can become fearful, as once familiar places and activities become strange. As a result, they may crave routine and avoid new situations.

What to Do
----------

If you think a loved one is showing signs of dementia,

*   Respectively check in with other family members or close friends to see if they have seen similar signs.
*   Ask your loved one how they think their memory is working. They may be relieved to talk with you if they have been noticing a decline themselves.
*   Encourage them to see their doctor, as their symptoms might be the result of something treatable. Offer to take them, if you think they may welcome your support.
*   If you think your loved one may not accept your help, enlist the aid of another family member or friend whose involvement your loved one might accept more easily.
