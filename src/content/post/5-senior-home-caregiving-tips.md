So here are five pieces of tips, and advice for those who want their loved ones to age as comfortably, independently, and vibrantly as possible within their own home.

ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH CARE IS NEEDED

TAKE CARE OF THE IMPORTANT PAPERWORK
------------------------------------

We all like to think nothing bad will ever happen to us or our older loved ones. Unfortunately, as we age, our chances for debilitating medical problems increase. No matter how healthy you are or how young you feel, you could suffer from a stroke or heart attack tomorrow, leaving you completely incapacitated. The fact of the matter is that we simply never know what the future holds. However, you can alleviate some of the stress in a worst-case scenario by ensuring that all of your affairs are in order now. Don’t wait for tragedy to strike. Be prepared.

Collect your important papers in order because when an emergency happens, these documents are going to be crucial to getting things in order. That’s why you need to make sure to collect or file all of your papers in one place. And always make sure to make copies of these papers and keep them updated. Some examples of these important documents are birth certificates, social security cards, marriage certificates and others. You may also wish to create one or more of the following documents while getting your affairs in order. These documents are a will or trust, an advance directive, and a power of attorney.

Many of our clients and their families in the Longboat Key, Siesta Key, Sarasota, Lakewood Ranch, and Venice area of Florida feel that getting their affairs in order can be overwhelming. You may not always know the right decision to make. But taking the time to do this now is the most important thing you can do to secure your future.

PREVENT FREQUENT FALLS
----------------------

While we can't deny the fact that aging is inevitable, still a good number of the risk factors that contribute to fall at home in the elderly. It can be modified in order to prevent them and where they have already occurred, a recurrence can be averted. Some of the actionable steps to make your home safer include good lighting, no clutter, removing tripping hazards, installing handrails in the bathrooms and steps, wear a fall alert bracelets. Also consider getting a hip or limb protector which helps to prevent a fracture if a fall does occur. And ensuring that outside walk paths are well swept and that unbroken or uneven walking surfaces are repaired.

Asides from these safety tips for in-home senior care, maintaining optimum health and well-being is hugely beneficial in reducing the risk of fall at home in the elderly. A few tips on how to achieve this include eating a balanced diet, especially foods rich in vitamin D and calcium. Drinking a lot of fluids, staying physically active through regular exercise, making the eye a health priority and maintaining regular visits to doctors.

KEEP AN EYE ON THEIR DRIVING ISSUES
-----------------------------------

There is a saying that "when in doubt, don't go out". Driving is an important skill in this day and age and when we start to lose that skill, it may cast a lot of doubt and worry on us as regards our abilities as people. There are certain red flags that need to be aware of to decide whether or not we will still let our senior parents drive cars the way they usually do. Some of these red flags are multiple auto crashes and near misses, two or more car tickets, warnings within the last two years, increased anxiety about night driving, complaints about inappropriate speeding, problems obeying traffic signs, and an outright recommendation from a doctor to stop driving because of a medical condition.

So it doesn't just stop at taking away the keys from mom and dad when their driving starts to become more of a concern than a beneficial skill, we must also hand back some reassurance to them also that it is okay to get old and to make life style modifications appropriate for their age and perhaps their medical condition also.
