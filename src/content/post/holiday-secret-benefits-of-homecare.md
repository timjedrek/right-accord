The holidays often bring to mind images of family and friends gathering around the dinner table, exchanging gifts and creating memories that will last a lifetime.

Unfortunately, for many seniors, the holidays can be a difficult time of year due to age-related health issues or mobility issues that make it difficult for them to get out and about and take part in the festivities. Home health care provided by professional caregivers can make a world of difference in helping seniors enjoy the holidays and all the joy they bring.

Not only can caregivers help seniors with their daily activities, but they can also provide a sense of companionship and emotional support to make the holidays a special time of year. From helping seniors prepare for holiday events to providing transportation to and from holiday gatherings, professional caregivers can make the holidays a time of connection, joy, and peace of mind.

What is Home Health Care?
-------------------------

Home health care is a type of non-medical care that enables seniors to remain in their homes as long as possible through the provision of services that address all aspects of daily living.

A range of professional healthcare providers can be employed to provide a range of services such as nursing care, physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, diet and nutrition instruction, medical social work, and more.

Seniors who require assistance with daily activities that they can't do on their own may be candidates for home health care. One of the benefits of home health care is that it can be tailored to each individual’s needs, preferences and lifestyle. For example, a senior who wants to keep driving may receive assistance with medications so he or she can stay behind the wheel.

On the other hand, a senior who is no longer able to drive may receive assistance with daily tasks such as grocery shopping and errands so he or she can remain in the comfort of his or her own home.

The holiday season can be a time of anxiety for seniors who may be uncertain about the events they need to attend or who may feel they don’t have the energy to get everything done. A professional caregiver can provide reassurance and support by helping with daily tasks and sharing in the senior’s activities.

### Caregivers can assist with holiday preparation

From baking holiday treats to decorating the house, there is a lot that needs to get done this time of year. A professional caregiver can help with holiday preparation by getting involved, pitching in, and providing support.
