## What Happens if My Loved One Needs More Care Hours?

When a loved one first begins in-home care, it’s common to start with a schedule that fits their immediate needs — maybe a few hours a week for companionship, meal prep, or light assistance. But over time, needs can change.

A sudden illness, hospital stay, or a gradual health decline might mean your loved one requires more hours of care than before.

At **RIGHT ACCORD** Private Duty Home Health Care, we understand that life doesn’t always follow a set plan. That’s why we’ve built our care model around flexibility — so when your family needs more help, we can adapt quickly and seamlessly.

## Why Care Needs Often Increase

Needing more care hours isn’t unusual. Here are some common reasons:

- **Health Changes**
   - Recovery from surgery or injury
   - Worsening of chronic conditions (e.g., arthritis, heart disease, COPD)
   - New diagnosis requiring more hands-on care
- **Mobility Decline**
   - Increased risk of falls
   - Difficulty walking, transferring, or climbing stairs
- **Cognitive Changes**
   - Advancing dementia or Alzheimer’s symptoms
   - Increased confusion or disorientation
- **Family Caregiver Burnout**
   - When family members can’t keep up with the demands of care
   - Need for more respite time

## How RIGHT ACCORD Responds When You Need More Hours

We believe in making schedule changes as simple as possible for families. Here’s how the process works:


1. **A Quick Call to Your Care Manager**
- Families can reach us by phone or email to request changes.
- We discuss your concerns, reasons for the change, and ideal schedule adjustments.
2. **Immediate Assessment (If Needed)**
- For significant changes, we can arrange a free in-home reassessment to evaluate new needs.
- We also review the care plan to ensure the right caregiver skills match your loved one’s situation.
3. **Schedule Updates Within 24–48 Hours**
- Most requests for extra hours can be fulfilled in one to two days.
- Urgent needs, such as post-hospital discharge, can often be accommodated the same day.
4. **Seamless Communication with Caregivers**
- We inform your assigned caregiver(s) about the updated schedule.
- If additional caregivers are needed, we carefully select team members who fit your loved one’s preferences and care requirements.

## Flexible Care Options at RIGHT ACCORD

We know every family’s needs are unique — and that’s why our scheduling is built for flexibility.

- **Add Hours Gradually** — Increase from 4 hours/day to 6, or add an extra visit per week.
- **Temporary Care Boost** — More hours for a short-term recovery, then return to your normal schedule.
- **Overnight Care** — Peace of mind for families concerned about falls, wandering, or nighttime needs.

## Real-Life Example: From Part-Time to Expanded Support

Mary’s mother in Venice started with 10 hours of weekly companion care for errands, meals, and light housekeeping.
After a hospitalization, she needed around-the-clock monitoring for two weeks during recovery. **RIGHT ACCORD** was able to:
- Arrange extended coverage within 24 hours of discharge
- Assign caregivers familiar with Mary’s mother for comfort and consistency
- Gradually reduce hours as her mother regained independence


Mary shared, _“I never felt stressed about the changes. RIGHT ACCORD made everything so smooth — I felt supported every step of the way.”_

## Why Flexibility Matters for Families

When your care provider can adapt quickly:
- Your loved one avoids gaps in care
- You have peace of mind knowing help is available
- Care transitions feel seamless instead of disruptive
- You can focus on spending quality time together instead of scrambling for help

## How We Keep Families in the Loop
We believe communication is just as important as care itself. Whenever you change your hours, you can expect:
- Written confirmation of your new schedule
- Updated invoices reflecting only the care you’ve requested
- Regular check-ins to make sure the new plan is working well
