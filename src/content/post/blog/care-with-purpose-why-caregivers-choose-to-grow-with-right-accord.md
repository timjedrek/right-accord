### 👩‍⚕️ Maria G., CNA – Sarasota, FL

> I've worked for several agencies before, but RIGHT ACCORD is different. They actually listen to us caregivers. I feel valued—not just another number.

### 👵🏼 Anna R., Client Family Member – Manatee County

> Our caregiver from RIGHT ACCORD has become like family. I asked her one day why she chose RIGHT ACCORD, and she said, ‘Because they respect me and care about the people I care for.’ That meant everything to me.
