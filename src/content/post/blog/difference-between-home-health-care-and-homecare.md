### Home Health Care vs. Homecare

**Home Health Care** is medical and requires a doctor‚Äôs order. It includes services like nursing, physical therapy, and medication management.

**Homecare** is non-medical. It includes help with bathing, cooking, light cleaning, companionship, and more.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature                  | Home Health Care        | Homecare                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Type of Care             | Medical                 | Non-medical              |
| Staff                    | Nurses, therapists      | Caregivers, aides        |
| Requires Doctor‚Äôs Order  | Yes                     | No                       |
| Insurance Coverage       | Often covered           | Sometimes                |
| Duration                 | Short-term              | Ongoing support          |
| Focus                    | Recovery and treatment  | Daily life and safety    |

### When Families Use Both

Many seniors benefit from both services. A nurse may visit to provide medical care, while a caregiver supports with meals, bathing, and companionship.

### Choosing the Right Care

Ask these questions:

1. Does my loved one need medical or personal support?
2. Is care short-term or ongoing?
3. Are there insurance benefits available?
4. How many hours of care are needed?
