### Why Spring Safety for Seniors Matters

As temperatures rise, so do seasonal risks. From slippery porches to pollen allergies, spring can be a tough season for older adults. With the right support, however, seniors can stay safe and enjoy the sunshine.

### Key Hazards and How Homecare Helps

#### 1. Slips and Falls
Spring rain means wet floors and slick walkways. Homecare aides help seniors move safely and keep common areas dry and clutter-free.

#### 2. Allergies
Pollen is everywhere in spring. Caregivers help manage symptoms by cleaning often, keeping windows shut, and tracking changes in health.

#### 3. Cleaning Risks
Spring cleaning can stir up dust or expose mold. Homecare teams use safe cleaning products and help seniors avoid respiratory irritants.

#### 4. Medication Mix-Ups
Allergy season means new meds, which may interact with existing ones. Homecare ensures medications are taken safely and on schedule.

#### 5. Outdoor Time
Fresh air is great‚Äîbut caregivers help avoid sunburn, dehydration, and confusion during walks or yard time.

#### 6. Nutrition and Fluids
Spring can throw off routines. Homecare workers help plan meals and remind clients to drink water regularly.

#### 7. Home Maintenance
Spring projects add safety concerns. Caregivers monitor activity, assist with planning, and keep seniors away from risky areas.

#### 8. Emotional Wellness
Shifting routines and longer days can cause confusion or low moods. Companionship and routine help restore emotional balance.
