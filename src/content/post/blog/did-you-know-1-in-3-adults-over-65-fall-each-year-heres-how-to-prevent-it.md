**Did You Know? 1 in 3 Adults Over 65 Fall Each Year --- Here's How to
Prevent It**

## The Hidden Danger of Falls

It's a startling fact: **1 in 3 adults over the age of 65 experiences a
fall each year.** For many families, this statistic becomes personal
only after an accident happens---a broken hip, a trip to the emergency
room, or a sudden loss of independence.

But here's the good news: **falls are not an inevitable part of aging.**
With the right precautions, families can reduce risks and keep seniors
safe and confident at home.

At **RIGHT ACCORD Private Duty--Home Health Care**, serving Sarasota,
Venice, Manatee, Lee, and Charlotte Counties, we've seen firsthand how
small changes can prevent big accidents.

## Why Falls Are So Common Among Older Adults

Falls aren't random---they often result from a combination of factors:

-   **Weakened muscles and balance issues** due to aging.

-   **Medications** that cause dizziness or drowsiness.

-   **Vision problems** that make it harder to spot hazards.

-   **Chronic conditions** such as arthritis, diabetes, or Parkinson's disease.

-   **Environmental risks** like loose rugs, poor lighting, or cluttered walkways.

For seniors, even a "simple" fall can have serious
consequences---fractures, head injuries, hospitalizations, or long-term
mobility loss. That's why **prevention is key.**

## The Impact of Falls on Families

Beyond physical injuries, falls can have lasting emotional and financial
effects:

-   **Fear of falling again**, leading to reduced activity and social isolation.

-   **Loss of independence**, sometimes resulting in relocation to assisted living.

-   **High medical costs** from hospital stays, surgeries, and rehabilitation.

-   **Emotional strain** on both the senior and their family caregivers.

By taking proactive steps, families can avoid these setbacks and protect
quality of life.

## 5 Essential Fall Prevention Strategies

### 1. Strengthen the Body

Regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to reduce fall risks.
Activities such as walking, tai chi, or light strength training improve
balance, flexibility, and coordination.

*Tip:* Sarasota has community centers and wellness programs for seniors
that encourage safe physical activity. RIGHT ACCORD caregivers can also
assist with simple at-home exercises.

### 2. Review Medications

Some prescriptions increase fall risks by causing dizziness or fatigue.
Seniors should review all medications---both prescription and
over-the-counter---with their doctor or pharmacist at least once a year.

### 3. Schedule Vision and Hearing Check-Ups

Poor vision or hearing makes it harder to navigate safely. Regular
check-ups can ensure seniors have the right glasses or hearing aids to
stay alert and steady.

### 4. Make the Home Safer

Most falls happen at home. A few adjustments can create a safer
environment:

-   Remove loose rugs or tape them down.

-   Add grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairs.

-   Improve lighting in hallways and entryways.

-   Keep frequently used items within easy reach.

-   Clear clutter and secure cords.

*Bonus:* RIGHT ACCORD offers home safety assessments to help families
identify hazards they might overlook.

### 5. Consider Professional Home Care Support

When mobility or health issues increase fall risks, having a trained
caregiver can make a big difference. Caregivers can:

-   Assist with bathing, dressing, and mobility.

-   Supervise daily routines to prevent accidents.

-   Provide companionship that encourages activity and reduces
    isolation.

-   Offer transportation to reduce risks outside the home.
