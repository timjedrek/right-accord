### What Caregivers Wish They Knew

1. **The diagnosis is only the beginning.**  
Alzheimer’s is progressive. Planning ahead helps ease the road.

2. **You can’t do it all—and you shouldn’t try.**  
Respite care and support teams prevent burnout.

3. **Your love remains, even as the person changes.**  
Connection may look different, but it still matters.

4. **Every day may look different.**  
Structure and flexibility help manage unpredictability.

5. **Safety becomes a concern quickly.**  
Prepare the home and routines early for supervision.

6. **Communication changes—but connection doesn’t.**  
Touch, music, and photos often speak louder than words.

7. **Self-care is not selfish.**  
You must care for yourself to care for others.
