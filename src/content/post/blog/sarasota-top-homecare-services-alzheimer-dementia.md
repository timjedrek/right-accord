   ensures that our caregivers are well-equipped to handle the challenges that can come
   with these conditions.

   desire to help. Our caregivers build meaningful relationships with their clients, providing
   not just care, but also emotional support and companionship.
4. **Ongoing Support:** Alzheimer’s and dementia are progressive conditions, which means
   that care needs can change over time. We are committed to providing ongoing support,
