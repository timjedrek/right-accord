### What Is a Legal Guardian?

A legal guardian is appointed to make decisions for someone unable to manage on their own.

### What About Social Security?

Legal guardianship doesn’t grant access to benefits. You must apply separately as a **Representative Payee** with the SSA.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local SSA office**  
2. **Fill out Form SSA-11**  
3. **Wait for SSA approval**  

### Your Responsibilities as a Payee

- Use funds for your loved one’s needs  
- Save unused money  
- Report changes to the SSA  
- File an annual report  

### How Homecare Helps

- Keeps loved ones safe and cared for  
- Monitors for scams or mail issues  
- Provides respite for guardians  
- Tracks behavior or health changes  

💙 You’re not just managing money—you’re protecting a life.
