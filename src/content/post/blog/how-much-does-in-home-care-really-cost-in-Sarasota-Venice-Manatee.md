When families begin exploring in-home care, one of the first and most important questions is:

### “How much will it cost?”

It’s a fair question — and one that deserves an honest, straightforward answer. At RIGHT ACCORD Private Duty Home Health Care, we believe transparency is essential. You deserve to know exactly what you’re paying for, what affects your costs, and how to plan for care without feeling overwhelmed.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through:
- **Factors that influence in-home care costs**
- **Average rates in Sarasota, Venice, and Manatee Counties**
- **Tips to make home care more affordable**
- **How RIGHT ACCORD provides value beyond the price tag**

## Why Costs Can Vary So Much?

No two care situations are exactly alike. The cost of home care depends on several key factors:
1. **Level of Care Needed**
  - Companion Care: Assistance with errands, light housekeeping, meal preparation, and companionship.
  - Personal Care: Includes hands-on help with bathing, grooming, mobility, and medication reminders.
  - Specialized Care: For individuals with conditions like dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or recovering from surgery.
2. **Number of Hours Per Week**
  - Some clients need just a few hours a week for light help.
  - Others require 24-hour or full-time support.
3. **Schedule & Flexibility**
  - Weekends, nights, or holidays can sometimes cost more.
  - Last-minute schedule changes may impact staffing and rates.
4. **Location & Travel Time**
  - Travel within Sarasota, Venice, Manatee, Lee, and Charlotte Counties is standard for RIGHT ACCORD, but rural areas may require adjustments.

## Average In-Home Care Costs in Our Area

## Why Families Choose In-Home Care Over Other Options

When comparing costs, many families weigh home care against assisted living or nursing homes.
- Assisted Living in Sarasota/Manatee: Typically $4,500–$6,500/month for shared space and set schedules.
- Nursing Home Care: Can exceed $9,000/month for a private room.
- In-Home Care: Flexible schedules, one-on-one attention, and the comfort of staying in your own home.

For many families, in-home care offers better emotional well-being and a tailored plan — without the stress of moving to a facility.

## How to Make Home Care More Affordable
1. **Start with a Needs Assessment**

**RIGHT ACCORD** offers a free in-home assessment to determine exactly how many hours and what type of care is required — avoiding unnecessary costs.

2. **Use Caregiver Hours Wisely**

Consolidate tasks into caregiver visits to get the most value.

3. **Explore Financial Resources**

  * Veterans benefits (Aid & Attendance)
  * Long-term care insurance
  * Medicaid programs (where applicable)
  * Private grants or local assistance programs

4. **Adjust as Needs Change**

  You may start with more hours post-hospital discharge, then scale back as recovery progresses — or vice versa.

## Why RIGHT ACCORD’s Pricing is Transparent

We know “surprise fees” are one of the biggest frustrations families face in healthcare. That’s why we:

- Provide a clear written service agreement before care begins.
- Offer itemized invoices so you always know what you’re paying for.
- Adjust care plans with your approval — never without your consent.
- Include regular communication from your Care Manager for peace of mind.

## Real Story: How Transparent Pricing Helped One Sarasota Family

After her father was discharged from the hospital, Linda from Sarasota contacted several agencies. Many gave vague answers about cost — or only shared rates after a long sales pitch.

When she called **RIGHT ACCORD**, we provided:

1. A **same-day ballpark estimate** over the phone
2. A **free home visit** the next day
3. A **clear, customized care plan** with costs broken down by service

Linda later told us, _"I felt like I could trust you from the very first call — because you respected my need for real numbers.”_
