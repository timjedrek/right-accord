Anyone who has lived through the Great Depression, or any other challenging period in their life, may find that they are prone to depression with age.

The elderly can struggle with depression for a variety of reasons. They may no longer have the support of friends and family who previously helped them through hard times. They may see their lives as though they have nothing to look forward to. Or perhaps they've experienced too much pain and sadness for too long. If you know a senior or an older adult who is struggling with these challenges, there are ways you can help them find peace and happiness again.
