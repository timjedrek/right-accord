Springtime brings a bounty of fresh fruits and vegetables that are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients that are good for the heart. For example, strawberries are high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which can help reduce inflammation and support healthy blood vessels.

Asparagus is another springtime favorite that is rich in folate, which can help lower levels of homocysteine, a compound linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Other heart-healthy springtime foods include leafy greens, salmon, and nuts.

### Asparagus

Asparagus is a nutrient-dense vegetable that is low in calories and high in fiber. It is also rich in vitamins A, C, E, and K, as well as folate and chromium.

Try roasting asparagus in the oven with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper for a simple and delicious side dish.

Salmon is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and improve heart health. It is also high in protein and low in saturated fat, making it a heart-healthy choice for seniors. Try grilling or baking salmon and serving it with a side of asparagus or roasted vegetables.
