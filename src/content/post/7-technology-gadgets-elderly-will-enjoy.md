The advancement of new technology this coming 2023 and beyond provides us a set of game changing tools that will enhance the life of our elderly. Affordable high-tech devices, apps, and gadgets offer breakthrough solutions to the everyday problems they encounter.

Elisa's 75 year old Mom is still living alone with herself. She lives next door to her home just about 50 feet apart from each other's house in Florida, so if there's an emergency, she can be able to get to her within a minute. A couple of days ago, her Mom had a minor fall, she only got a couple of bruises, but it completely made Elisa think that she needs some kind of medical alert device. Something that would alert her if her Mom fell again or were otherwise in distress.

Her friends suggested installing camera devices that could monitor her Mom 24/7. They also suggest using a voice controlled speaker that she can set up so if her Mom says "Call For Help" it will text and call her and she can talk to her Mom through the device. They also advise her to use a fall detection watch for her Mom where in the case the app detects a hard fall while her mom is wearing a watch, it will tap her on the wrist, sounds an alarm, and displays an alert.

Now, Elisa regularly logs into a website to check her Mom's activity, captured via wifi connection, and remotely monitors her. She can see the number of times her Mom opens the refrigerator, and when she goes into the bathroom or heads out the door. An app can alert Elisa by text, email, web or phone if something is out of the ordinary.

"By using the full potential of this new technology, it allows me to feel emotionally confident and secure that my Mom can stay in her home longer," said Elisa.

Amazon Echo Dot
---------------

The Amazon Echo Dot is a voice-activated and controlled speaker that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, make calls, answer questions, set timers and alarms, and more.

Alexa is a smart cookie, built inside the Echo Dot devices and Echo is a device that uses speech recognition to perform an ever-growing range of tasks on command. Alexa's smartness relies on the internet, in the cloud-computing service run by Amazon. This converts the recording into commands that it interprets. It's more than a simple voice-to-text service. It is a fully programmable service that can work with other online services to do a surprising range of things such as playing music, receive news updates, check the weather, or set alarms to take medications.

You can set it up in their bedroom, living room, kitchen, and in their bathroom. Its built-in speaker can hear you from across the room with 7 far-field microphones for hands-free control, even in noisy environments or while playing music. So, if she says “Alexa Call For Help” it will text and call you and you can talk to him through the device.

Amazon isn't the only game in town for this sort of thing: Google, Apple, and Microsoft does offer the same voice commands feature that can do a variety of tasks. OK Google, Siri, and Cortana use the same approach but most aren't as flexible or as integrated with other services as Alexa is.

If your Apple Watch detects that you are not moving for at least about a minute, it will automatically make a call.

After it ends the call, your watch sends a message to your emergency contacts within your location informing them that your watch detected a hard fall. Your watch gets your emergency contacts from your Medical ID.

You have the option to inform your emergency contacts or you can dismiss the alert message by pressing the Digital Crown and tapping Close, or by tapping "I'm OK." phrase.
