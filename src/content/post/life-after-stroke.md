Surviving a stroke is no easy feat. Life after a stroke is sometimes a whole new world all together. Depending on the type of stroke, the part of the body affected, and its severity, the effects vary from person to person.

**The [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/bod_cerebrovasculardiseasestroke.pdf), defines stroke as a neurological deficit (an abnormal functioning of a part of the body) of cerebrovascular cause (referring to flow of blood in the brain) that persists beyond 24 hours, or is interrupted by death within 24 hours.**

Stroke survivors usually have to learn new habits, new ways of doing things, or may even have to rely on things being done for them. They may find surprising new developments or defects in their bodies that they would have to cope with, live with or recover from. Below, we will be looking at strategies that will help stroke survivors and their caregivers go through this path of recovery.

WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS OF STROKE?
------------------------------------

There are several risk factors of stroke and some of them include:

*   High blood pressure
*   High blood cholesterol
*   Obesity
*   Diabetes
*   Tobacco smoking

WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF STROKE?
-----------------------------

Common signs of stroke to look out for include:

*   Headache
*   Face weakness of sudden onset
*   Arm weakness
*   Abnormal speech

The [Department of Health, UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/acting-fast-can-save-hundreds-of-lives) has come up with a mnemonic "FAST", which stands for

*   Facial droop
*   Arm weakness
*   Speech difficulty
*   Time to call emergency services.

Further symptoms and signs, depending on which part of the brain is primarily affected may include:

*   Paralysis affecting one side of the body
*   Numbness, loss of sense of touch
*   Sensory reduction
*   Weakness of muscles
*   Altered sense of smell and taste
*   Difficulty in balance and posture
*   Difficulty in speech comprehension
*   Involuntary movements
*   Lack of insight and difficulty in cognitive functions
*   Urinary or fecal incontinence

These and many more are the presentations of patients who have suffered from Stroke. Usually, a diagnosis is made based on the history and the examination findings.

A CT Scan is also a vital tool not only in making a diagnosis of stroke, but to accurately map the region is of the brain affected.

HOW DO YOU MANAGE A PERSON WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM STROKE?
--------------------------------------------------------

The management of a stroke patient will begin from making the right diagnosis of the particular type of stroke the patient has suffered from.

Usually, the condition may first be treated by any of the following:

*   Breaking down the blood clot, usually with the use of drugs.
*   Surgically taking out the blood clot from the part of the brain affected.
*   The increasing pressure inside the skull may also need to be relieved.
*   If the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel, it would have to be repaired.
*   Rehabilitation

Quality of life after stroke varies with people, their temperaments, age, family support structure, and the amount of professional involvement sought for.

It is also important to note that it is usually best to begin rehabilitation of survivors as soon as possible and the target of recovery will also have to be modified to suit each patient depending on the type of stroke suffered and the part of the brain affected.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE STROKE?
------------------------------

People who have suffered from stroke are likely to have another episode; therefore their life afterwards will involve a lot of modifications and lifestyle changes.

These required changes coupled with the new and unusual ways of doing things or even the inability to do certain routine activities may lead to certain behavioral changes .

Changes seen in recovering stroke patients may include:

#### Depression

The new reality of having to give up a lot of one's routine lifestyle and even work in some cases may lead to depression .

#### Anger

As a form of grief, stroke survivors may lash out often at people around them, they may get upset about their situation and with themselves.

#### Anxiety

This may also be felt on the way to recovery. There may be the fear of another impending attack or even anxiety about the attention they may call to themselves usually from the changes in their movement and gait.

A rehabilitation process will have to be instituted in order to help them cope with the new realities of the condition as well as aid recovery from its disabling aftermath.

Stroke rehabilitation may usually take time depending on the severity of the condition and how much deficit was left in its wake. It is best to commence as soon as the patient is out of the woods, that is, once the physician concludes that the patient is no longer under any life threatening condition from the stroke.

The physician may also give drugs like Aspirin to certain patients to prevent a recurrence of stroke. Family and loved ones have a huge role to also play in the rehabilitation process.

*   **Encourage Use, Discourage Disuse;** It is quite easier for a stroke survivor to naturally resort to carrying out functions with the parts of side of the body not affected by the stroke while neglecting the affected side.
