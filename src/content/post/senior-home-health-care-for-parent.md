Whether you are looking for independent living, assisted living, or home care, there are many options available to you. Generally, seniors don’t get thrilled with the idea of moving away from their homes, preferring to stay independent as long as possible. Here, we will consider the options available that allow varying degrees of independence.

INDEPENDENT LIVING
------------------

This alternative offers the highest degree of independence to your parents. If they are quite capable of completing a majority of their daily tasks by themselves, then you should consider l etting them remain in their own homes.

In some situations, all that is required is a few home modifications and upgrades and with the necessary arrangements, your parents can live at home and you get to spend a lot less money than it would cost you to move them into a facility.

Bear in mind that the wish or desire of your parents to live at home is not enough to let them. A careful assessment of their capabilities is needed as discussed in previous chapters.

Unlike before when nursing homes seemed to be the only option for seniors requiring some form of help, a lot of options are now available. Now if a senior does not have special medical and health needs, they do not need to be moved to nursing homes. Any basic assistance they require can be arranged to be offered in- house.
